### Password Generator

Home work assignment #3 was to set up the logic for a password generator that used the following criteria:
    *Password length must be between 8 and 128 characters, no more, no less.
    *Must have the option to include or exclude: uppercase, lowercase, special, and numerical characters (although at least one of these must be chosen.)
    *When password is generated, it must be displayed onto the page.
